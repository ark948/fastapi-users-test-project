> pip install fastapi[standard] fastapi-users[sqlalchemy] uvicorn[standard] aiosqlite


- evironment variables need to go to env file
> pip install python-dotenv


- need to convert this into an app (done)
- add alembic 



authentication backend = (transport + strategy)

AuthenticationBackend --> (BearerTransport + JWTSTrategy)

- adding alembic:
> pip install alembic
> alembic init alembic
- import and add user model and Base model object (wherever they are)
- also i'm moving sqlalchemy Base object to src.db (from auth app)
- update the database url in alembic.ini file (only include the sqlite not other toolkits such as aiosqlite)
run the following command:
> alembic revision --autogenerate -m "create users table"
- edit the revision file (probably imports such as fastapi_users_db_sqlalchemy)
run the migration:
> alembic upgrade head
add a field to user model to test alembic (like first name)
make new migration
> alembic revision --autogenerate -m "add name"
> alembic upgrade head
> test the new fields (do not forget to update the schemas as well)
